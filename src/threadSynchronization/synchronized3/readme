simple example of the synchronized mechanism.
2 threads trying to access 2 different methods on the same object declared with the synchronized keyword.
one method is static method of the SharedData class 
and the other method is an instance method of the SharedData class.

expected result: 
Only one execution thread will access one of the static
methods declared with the synchronized keyword, but another thread can access other nonstatic
methods of an object of that class.
