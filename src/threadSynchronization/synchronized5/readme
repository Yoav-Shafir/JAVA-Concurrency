use case of 2 threads that invoke the same synchronized method and
immediately call the wait() method inside that synchronized method - wait() tells the calling thread to give up the monitor and go to sleep until some other 
thread enters the same monitor and calls notify().

then we have a another thread which wakes the threads by calling the notifyAll() method.
which thread will be resumed first? and how will it be executed.

expected result:
only one thread at a time will be executed until it exits the synchronized method or go again to wait state.
