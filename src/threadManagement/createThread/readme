- A Java program ends when all its threads finish (more specifically, when all its non-daemon
threads finish.

- If the initial thread (the one that executes the main() method) ends, the rest
of the threads will continue with their execution until they finish.

- If one of the threads use the
System.exit() instruction to end the execution of the program, all the threads end
their execution.
